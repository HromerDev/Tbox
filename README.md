Tbox Video Game Console

a videogame console that can run games such as Snake and Tetris built for ESP32 (may work on different chips with some changes)

Project is built and written using Visual Studio PlatformIO Extension in the programming language c++, controlled by 2 Joysticks and rendered onto 2 8x8 LED matrices serially connected to each other.

My build with a built box(box not required)
